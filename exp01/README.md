The goal of this task is to simulate the behavior of a worm in a simple way.

Set up a virtual machine and use netcat to simulate a backdoor inside the VM. It must be able to write and execute files.

Simulate a worm from outside the VM, which will: enumerate the VM ports (see nmap); find the backdoor; connect to it; send and execute an executable file (e.g., the calculator).

Write a report detailing every step taken. Make clear which tools were used, e.g., netcat-traditional package/version K.

All steps must be replicable!
