The analysis of network traffic is critical in intrusion detection. Here is a file of network traffic in pcap format that corresponds to a real attack to a computer system, from beginning to end. Analyze the traffic file and answer the following questions:
 - Which are the involved systems (IP addresses)?
 - Where are geographically located the attacking hosts?
 - How many TCP sessions the traffic file contains?
 - How long did the attack last?
 - What were the actions taken during the attack (general outline of the steps)?
 - Was there any malicious code (malware) involved and, if so, what was the name of the malware, if identifyable by anti-malware mechanisms (like VirusTotal, for instance)?
